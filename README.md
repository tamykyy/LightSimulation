# Light Simulation in 2D Game Space Using Cellular Automata
## Overview
This project implements a method for simulating light in a 2D game environment using cellular automata. Unlike traditional ray tracing or radiosity techniques, cellular automata allow for efficient real-time simulation of wave-like light behavior, including diffraction and interference.

## Features
- Wave-based light propagation using cellular automata
- Support for diffraction and interference effects
- Configurable grid size and update rules
- Simple integration into 2D game engines
